This is a LinkedIn website clone. I am building this with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The website includes 2 web pages - the LinkedIn <b>landing page</b> and a home <b>feed</b>. After a user might have signed in on the first page, they are taken to the second page which shows a timeline feed links to other information.
